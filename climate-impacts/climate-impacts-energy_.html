		<ul><li>Climate change is likely to both increase electricity demand for cooling in the summer and decrease electricity, natural gas, heating oil, and wood demand for heating in the winter. New infrastructure investments may be necessary to meet increased energy demand, especially peak demand during heat waves.</li>
			<li>Climate change could affect the amount of water available to produce electricity or extract fuel. In areas where water is already scarce, competition for water between energy production and other uses could increase.</li>
			<li>Sea level rise and more frequent intense storms could disrupt energy production and delivery by damaging electricity infrastructure, fuel delivery infrastructure and equipment, power plants, or storage facilities.</li>
		</ul></div>
</div>

<p>Changes in temperature, precipitation, sea level, and the frequency and severity of extreme events will affect how much energy is produced, delivered, and consumed in the United States.</p>

<p>Energy plays an important role in many aspects of our lives. For example, we use electricity for lighting and cooling. We use fuel for transportation, heating, and cooking. Our energy production and use is interconnected with many other aspects of modern life, such as water consumption, use of goods and services, transportation, economic growth, land use, and population growth. Our production and use of energy (most of which comes from fossil fuels) also <a href="/climate-change-science/causes-climate-change">contributes to climate change</a>, accounting for more than 84% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.<a href="#ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class="pagetop"><a href="#main-content">Top of Page</a></p>

<h2><a name="Supply and demand" id="Supply and demand"></a>Temperature, Energy Demand, and Energy Supply</h2>

<p>Increases in temperature will likely increase our energy demand, as well as change our ability to produce electricity and deliver it reliably.</p>

<ul class="roomy"><li>In a warmer climate, Americans will use more electricity for air conditioning and less natural gas, oil, and wood for heating. If the nation's climate warms by 1.8Â°F, the demand for energy used for cooling is expected to increase by about 5-20%, while the demand for energy used for heating is expected to decrease by about 3-15%.<a href="#ref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> Net expenditure in annual heating and cooling could increase by 10% ($26 billion in 1990 dollars) with a 4.5Â°F warming by the end of the century, and by 22% ($57 billion in 1990 dollars) with a warming of 9.0Â°F.<a href="#ref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Heating demand would decrease the most in the northern United States, and cooling demand would increase the most in the southern United States. Since demand for electricity for cooling is expected to increase as a result of temperature increase and extreme heat events, the balance in energy delivery is likely to shift from natural gas and fuel oil used for heating to electricity used for air conditioning.<a href="#ref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Changes in energy demand will likely affect greenhouse gas emissions, but the net effect depends on which energy sources, including alternative energy, are used for electricity and heating.</li>

		Warming is likely to increase summer peak electricity demand in most regions of the United States.<a href="#ref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Meeting increases in this peak demand could require investments in new energy generation and distribution infrastructure, and new mechanisms will need to manage system reliability and peak demand, which can be more expensive than average demand levels.<a href="#ref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> For example, based on a 6.3 to 9Â°F temperature increase, climate change could increase the need for additional electric generating capacity by roughly 10-20% by 2050. This would require hundreds of billions of dollars in additional investment.<a href="#ref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></li>
	<li>A warmer climate may reduce the efficiency of power production for many existing fossil fuel and nuclear power plants because these plants use water for cooling. The colder the water, the more efficient the generator. Thus, higher air and water temperatures could reduce the efficiency with which these plants convert fuel into electricity.<a href="#ref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></li>

Cooling water is needed to run many of today's power plants. Hydroelectricity (electricity produced by running water) is itself an important source of power in parts of the United States.</p>

<p>Changes in precipitation, increased risk of drought, reduced snowpack, and changes in the timing of snowmelt in spring will influence our patterns of energy and water use. For example:</p>

<ul class="roomy"><li>Power plants can require large amounts of water for cooling. On average, a kilowatt-hour of electricity (enough power to run 400 typical compact-fluorescent light bulbs for an hour) requires 25 gallons of water to be withdrawn from rivers or lakes.<a href="#ref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> Parts of the Southeast and Southwest face increased competition for water to meet the demands of population and economic growth while also protecting natural ecosystems. Many local governments in these regions have slowed or stopped plans for new power plants that require large withdrawals of water due to concerns about adequate availability of cooling water.<a href="#ref6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></li>
	<li>More frequent and severe heat waves will likely increase the demand for electricity in the Southeast and Southwest. At the same time, these areas are likely to experience reduced water supplies due to increased temperature and evaporation, as well as possible decreased rainfall. Since water is necessary for electricity production, these combined effects could stress water resources. For more information about climate change impacts in the Southeast and Southwest, please visit the <a href="/climate-impacts/climate-impacts-southeast">Southeast Impacts</a>Â and <a href="/climate-impacts/climate-impacts-southwest">Southwest Impacts</a>Â pages.</li>
	<li>Hydroelectric power plants are sensitive to the volume and timing of stream flows. In some regions, especially during times of increased rainfall, dam operators may have to allow some water to bypass the electric turbines to prevent downstream flooding.<a href="#ref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> Maintaining stream flow for hydroelectric dams could present conflicts with other activities, such as salmon habitat restoration in the <a href="/climate-impacts/climate-impacts-northwest">Pacific Northwest</a>.<a href="#ref4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></li>
	<li>Growing crops for biomass and biofuel energy could stress water resources in certain regions, depending on the type of crop, where it is grown, agricultural production in the region, and current water and nutrient management practices.<a href="#ref5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> Given the many factors involved, more research is needed to understand how climate change may affect these resources.<a href="#ref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></li>
	<li>Rising temperatures, increased evaporation, and drought may increase the need for energy-intensive methods of providing drinking and irrigation water. For example, desalinization plants can convert salt water into freshwater, but consume a lot of energy. Climate change may also require irrigation water to be pumped over longer distances, particularly in dry regions across the western United States.<a href="#ref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></li>

	<li>Flooding and intense storms can damage power lines and electricity distribution equipment. These events may also delay repair and maintenance work.

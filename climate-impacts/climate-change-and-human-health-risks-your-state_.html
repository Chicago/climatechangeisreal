<h2>​Risks to Human Health by State</h2>

<ul class="accordion"><li><span>Climate change poses </span><a href="/climate-impacts/climate-impacts-human-health">risks to human health</a><span>. In the United States, we are already seeing rising temperatures, increased frequency and intensity of some types of extreme weather, sea level rise, and other changes in weather and climate patterns (for more, see </span><a href="/climate-indicators">EPA's climate indicators</a><span>).</span></li>
</ul><p>We are all vulnerable to the health impacts associated with climate change. However, these climate and health risks vary across the country. Click on the map below or use the drop-down menu to learn about examples of climate-related health risks in your state and actions you can take to reduce these risks. Find <a href="#Other Climate and Health Resources">additional resources</a> for your area below the map.</p>

<p><strong>Adaptive Capacity</strong><br />
	The ability of a system to adjust to climate change (including climate variability and extremes) to moderate potential damages, to take advantage of opportunities, or to cope with the consequences.</p>

<p><strong><a id="Aerosols" name="Aerosols"></a>Aerosols</strong><br />
	Small particles or liquid droplets in the atmosphere that can absorb or reflect sunlight depending on their composition.</p>

<p><strong>Afforestation</strong><br />
	Planting of new forests on lands that historically have not contained forests. <a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p><strong>Albedo</strong><br />
	The amount of solar radiation reflected from an object or surface, often expressed as a percentage.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative Energy</strong><br />
	Energy derived from nontraditional sources (e.g., compressed natural gas, solar, hydroelectric, wind). <a href="#2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p><strong>Annex I Countries/Parties</strong><br />
	Group of countries included in Annex I (as amended in 1998) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, including all the developed countries in the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development, and economies in transition. By default, the other countries are referred to as Non-Annex I countries. Under Articles 4.2 (a) and 4.2 (b) of the Convention, Annex I countries commit themselves specifically to the aim of returning individually or jointly to their 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2000. <a href="#2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p><strong><a id="Anthropogenic" name="Anthropogenic"></a>Anthropogenic</strong><br />
	Made by people or resulting from human activities. Usually used in the context of emissions that are produced as a result of human activities. <a href="#3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p><strong><a id="Atmosphere" name="Atmosphere"></a>Atmosphere</strong><br />
	The gaseous envelope surrounding the Earth. The dry atmosphere consists almost entirely of nitrogen (78.1% volume mixing ratio) and oxygen (20.9% volume mixing ratio), together with a number of trace gases, such as argon (0.93% volume mixing ratio), helium, radiatively active greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (0.035% volume mixing ratio), and ozone. In addition the atmosphere contains water vapor, whose amount is highly variable but typically 1% volume mixing ratio. The atmosphere also contains clouds and aerosols. <a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p><strong><a name="Atmospheric Lifetime" id="Atmospheric Lifetime"></a>Atmospheric Lifetime</strong><br />
	Atmospheric lifetime is the average time that a molecule resides in the atmosphere before it is removed by chemical reaction or deposition. In general, if a quantity of a compound is emitted into the atmosphere at a particular time, about 35 percent of that quantity will remain in the atmosphere at the end of the compound's atmospheric lifetime. This fraction will continue to decrease in an exponential way, so that about 15 percent of the quantity will remain at the end of two times the atmospheric lifetime, etc. (Some compounds, most notably carbon dioxide, have more complex lifecycles, and their atmospheric lifetimes are not defined by a simple exponential equation.) Greenhouse gas lifetimes can range from a few years to a few thousand years.</p>

<p><strong><a id="B" name="B"></a>B</strong></p>

<p><strong>Biofuels</strong><br />
	Gas or liquid fuel made from plant material. Includes wood, wood waste, wood liquors, peat, railroad ties, wood sludge, spent sulfite liquors, agricultural waste, straw, tires, fish oils, tall oil, sludge waste, waste alcohol, municipal solid waste, landfill gases, other waste, and ethanol blended into motor gasoline. <a href="#4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p><strong>Biogeochemical Cycle</strong><br />
	Movements through the Earth system of key chemical constituents essential to life, such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorus. <a href="#3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p><strong>Biomass</strong><br />
	Materials that are biological in origin, including organic material (both living and dead) from above and below ground, for example, trees, crops, grasses, tree litter, roots, and animals and animal waste. <a href="#4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p><strong>Biosphere</strong><br />
	The part of the Earth system comprising all ecosystems and living organisms, in the atmosphere, on land (terrestrial biosphere) or in the oceans (marine biosphere), including derived dead organic matter, such as litter, soil organic matter and oceanic detritus. <a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p><strong>Black Carbon Aerosol</strong><br />
	Black carbon (BC) is the most strongly light-absorbing component of particulate matter (PM), and is formed by the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, biofuels, and biomass. It is emitted directly into the atmosphere in the form of fine particles (PM<sub>2.5</sub>).</p>

<p><strong>Borehole</strong><br />

<p><strong><a id="C" name="C"></a>C</strong></p>

<p><strong>Carbon Cycle</strong><br />
	All parts (reservoirs) and fluxes of carbon. The cycle is usually thought of as four main reservoirs of carbon interconnected by pathways of exchange. The reservoirs are the atmosphere, terrestrial biosphere (usually includes freshwater systems), oceans, and sediments (includes fossil fuels). The annual movements of carbon, the carbon exchanges between reservoirs, occur because of various chemical, physical, geological, and biological processes. The ocean contains the largest pool of carbon near the surface of the Earth, but most of that pool is not involved with rapid exchange with the atmosphere. <a href="#3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p><strong><a name="Carbon Dioxide" id="Carbon Dioxide"></a>Carbon Dioxide</strong><br />
	A naturally occurring gas, and also a by-product of burning fossil fuels and biomass, as well as land-use changes and other industrial processes. It is the principal human caused greenhouse gas that affects the Earth's radiative balance. It is the reference gas against which other greenhouse gases are measured and therefore has a Global Warming Potential of 1. See <a href="#Climate Change">climate change</a> and <a href="#Global Warming">global warming</a>. <a href="#5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p><strong>Carbon Dioxide Equivalent</strong><br />
	A metric measure used to compare the emissions from various greenhouse gases based upon their global warming potential (GWP). Carbon dioxide equivalents are commonly expressed as "million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (MMTCO<sub>2</sub>Eq)." The carbon dioxide equivalent for a gas is derived by multiplying the tons of the gas by the associated GWP.</p>

<p>MMTCO<sub>2</sub>Eq = (million metric tons of a gas) * (GWP of the gas)</p>

<p>See <a href="#Greenhouse Gas (GHG)">greenhouse gas</a>, <a href="#Global Warming Potential">global warming potential</a>, <a href="#Metric Ton">metric ton</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a name="Carbon Dioxide Fertilization" id="Carbon Dioxide Fertilization"></a>Carbon Dioxide Fertilization</strong><br />
	The enhancement of the growth of plants as a result of increased atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. Depending on their mechanism of photosynthesis, certain types of plants are more sensitive to changes in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. <a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p><strong>Carbon Footprint</strong><br />
	The total amount of greenhouse gases that are emitted into the atmosphere each year by a person, family, building, organization, or company. A persons carbon footprint includes greenhouse gas emissions from fuel that an individual burns directly, such as by heating a home or riding in a car. It also includes greenhouse gases that come from producing the goods or services that the individual uses, including emissions from power plants that make electricity, factories that make products, and landfills where trash gets sent.</p>

<p><strong><a name="Carbon Sequestration" id="Carbon Sequestration"></a>Carbon Sequestration</strong><br />
	Terrestrial, or biologic, carbon sequestration is the process by which trees and plants absorb carbon dioxide, release the oxygen, and store the carbon. Geologic sequestration is one step in the process of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), and involves injecting carbon dioxide deep underground where it stays permanently.</p>

<p><strong>Carbon Capture and Sequestration</strong><br />
	Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is a set of technologies that can greatly reduce carbon dioxide emissions from new and existing coal- and gas-fired power plants, industrial processes, and other stationary sources of carbon dioxide. It is a three-step process that includes capture of carbon dioxide from power plants or industrial sources; transport of the captured and compressed carbon dioxide (usually in pipelines); and underground injection and geologic sequestration, or permanent storage, of that carbon dioxide in rock formations that contain tiny openings or pores that trap and hold the carbon dioxide.</p>

<p><strong><a id="Chlorofluorocarbons" name="Chlorofluorocarbons"></a>Chlorofluorocarbons</strong><br />
	Gases covered under the 1987 Montreal Protocol and used for refrigeration, air conditioning, packaging, insulation, solvents, or aerosol propellants. Since they are not destroyed in the lower atmosphere, CFCs drift into the upper atmosphere where, given suitable conditions, they break down ozone. These gases are being replaced by other compounds: hydrochlorofluorocarbons, an interim replacement for CFCs that are also covered under the Montreal Protocol, and hydrofluorocarbons, which are covered under the Kyoto Protocol. All these substances are also greenhouse gases. See <a href="#Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs)">hydrochlorofluorocarbons</a>, <a href="#Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)">hydrofluorocarbons</a>, <a href="#Perfluorocarbons (PFCs)">perfluorocarbons</a>, <a href="#Ozone Depleting Substance (ODS)">ozone depleting substance</a>. <a href="#2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p><strong><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a>Climate</strong><br />
	Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the "average weather," or more rigorously, as the statistical description in terms of the mean and variability of relevant quantities over a period of time ranging from months to thousands of years. The classical period is 3 decades, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). These quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical description, of the climate system. See <a href="#Weather">weather</a>. <a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p><strong><a name="Climate Change" id="Climate Change"></a>Climate Change</strong><br />
	Climate change refers to any significant change in the measures of climate lasting for an extended period of time. In other words, climate change includes major changes in temperature, precipitation, or wind patterns, among others, that occur over several decades or longer.</p>

<p><strong><a name="Climate Feedback" id="Climate Feedback"></a>Climate Feedback</strong><br />
	A process that acts to amplify or reduce direct warming or cooling effects.</p>

<p><strong>Climate Lag</strong><br />
	The delay that occurs in climate change as a result of some factor that changes only very slowly. For example, the effects of releasing more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere occur gradually over time because the ocean takes a long time to warm up in response to a change in radiation. See <a href="#Climate">climate</a>, <a href="#Climate Change">climate change</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a name="Climate Model" id="Climate Model"></a>Climate Model</strong><br />
	A quantitative way of representing the interactions of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, and ice. Models can range from relatively simple to quite comprehensive. See <a href="#General Circulation Model (GCM)">General Circulation Model</a>. <a href="#3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p><strong>Climate Sensitivity</strong><br />
	In Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, equilibrium climate sensitivity refers to the equilibrium change in global mean surface temperature following a doubling of the atmospheric (equivalent) CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. More generally, equilibrium climate sensitivity refers to the equilibrium change in surface air temperature following a unit change in radiative forcing (degrees Celsius, per watts per square meter, (C/Wm-2). One method of evaluating the equilibrium climate sensitivity requires very long simulations with Coupled General Circulation Models (Climate model). The effective climate sensitivity is a related measure that circumvents this requirement. It is evaluated from model output for evolving non-equilibrium conditions. It is a measure of the strengths of the feedbacks at a particular time and may vary with forcing history and climate state. See <a href="#Climate">climate</a>, <a href="#Radiative Forcing">radiative forcing</a>. <a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p><strong>Climate System (or Earth System)</strong><br />
	The five physical components (atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere) that are responsible for the climate and its variations. <a href="#3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p><strong>Coal Mine Methane</strong><br />
	Coal mine methane is the subset of coalbed methane that is released from the coal seams during the process of coal mining. For more information, visit the <a href="/cmop">Coalbed Methane Outreach program site</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Coalbed Methane</strong><br />
	Coalbed methane is methane contained in coal seams, and is often referred to as virgin coalbed methane, or coal seam gas. For more information, visit the <a href="/cmop">Coalbed Methane Outreach program site</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Co-Benefit</strong><br />
	The benefits of policies that are implemented for various reasons at the same time including climate change mitigation acknowledging that most policies designed to address greenhouse gas mitigation also have other, often at least equally important, rationales (e.g., related to objectives of development, sustainability, and equity).</p>

<p><strong><a id="Concentration" name="Concentration"></a>Concentration</strong><br />
	Amount of a chemical in a particular volume or weight of air, water, soil, or other medium. See <a href="#Parts Per Billion (ppb)">parts per billion</a>, <a href="#Parts Per Million by Volume (ppmv)">parts per million</a>. <a href="#4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p><strong>Conference of the Parties</strong><br />
	The supreme body of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It comprises more than 180 nations that have ratified the Convention. Its first session was held in Berlin, Germany, in 1995 and it is expected to continue meeting on a yearly basis. The COP's role is to promote and review the implementation of the Convention. It will periodically review existing commitments in light of the Convention's objective, new scientific findings, and the effectiveness of national climate change programs. See <a href="#United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)">United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Coral Bleaching</strong><br />
	The process in which a coral colony, under environmental stress expels the microscopic algae (zooxanthellae) that live in symbiosis with their host organisms (polyps). The affected coral colony appears whitened.</p>

<p><strong>Cryosphere</strong><br />
	One of the interrelated components of the Earth's system, the cryosphere is frozen water in the form of snow, permanently frozen ground (permafrost), floating ice, and glaciers. Fluctuations in the volume of the cryosphere cause changes in ocean sea level, which directly impact the atmosphere and biosphere. <a href="#3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p><strong><a id="D" name="D"></a>D</strong></p>

<p><strong>Deforestation</strong><br />
	Those practices or processes that result in the conversion of forested lands for non-forest uses. Deforestation contributes to increasing carbon dioxide concentrations for two reasons: 1) the burning or decomposition of the wood releases carbon dioxide; and 2) trees that once removed carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in the process of photosynthesis are no longer present. <a href="#4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p><strong>Desertification</strong><br />
	Land degradation in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas resulting from various factors, including climatic variations and human activities. Further, the UNCCD (The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification) defines land degradation as a reduction or loss, in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas, of the biological or economic productivity and complexity of rain-fed cropland, irrigated cropland, or range, pasture, forest, and woodlands resulting from land uses or from a process or combination of processes, including processes arising from human activities and habitation patterns, such as: (i) soil erosion caused by wind and/or water; (ii) deterioration of the physical, chemical and biological or economic properties of soil; and (iii) long-term loss of natural vegetation. Conversion of forest to non-forest.</p>

<p><strong>Dryland Farming</strong><br />
	A technique that uses soil moisture conservation and seed selection to optimize production under dry conditions.</p>

<p><strong><a id="E" name="E"></a>E</strong></p>

<p><strong>Eccentricity</strong><br />
	The extent to which the Earth's orbit around the Sun departs from a perfect circle.</p>

<p><strong>Ecosystem</strong><br />
	Any natural unit or entity including living and non-living parts that interact to produce a stable system through cyclic exchange of materials. <a href="#3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p><strong>El Ni√±o - Southern Oscillation (ENSO)</strong><br />
	El Ni√±o in its original sense, is a warm water current that periodically flows along the coast of Ecuador and Peru, disrupting the local fishery. This oceanic event is associated with a fluctuation of the intertropical surface pressure pattern and circulation in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, called the Southern Oscillation. This coupled atmosphere-ocean phenomenon is collectively known as El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation. During an El Ni√±o event, the prevailing trade winds weaken and the equatorial countercurrent strengthens, causing warm surface waters in the Indonesian area to flow eastward to overlie the cold waters of the Peru current. This event has great impact on the wind, sea surface temperature, and precipitation patterns in the tropical Pacific. It has climatic effects throughout the Pacific region and in many other parts of the world. The opposite of an El Ni√±o event is called La Ni√±a. <a href="#6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p><strong>Emissions</strong><br />
	The release of a substance (usually a gas when referring to the subject of climate change) into the atmosphere.</p>

<p><strong>Emissions Factor</strong><br />
	A unique value for scaling emissions to activity data in terms of a standard rate of emissions per unit of activity (e.g., grams of carbon dioxide emitted per barrel of fossil fuel consumed, or per pound of product produced). <a href="#4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p><strong>Energy Efficiency</strong><br />

<p><strong>Intergovernmental Panel on climate Change (IPCC)</strong><br />
	The IPCC was established jointly by the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organization in 1988. The purpose of the IPCC is to assess information in the scientific and technical literature related to all significant components of the issue of climate change. The IPCC draws upon hundreds of the world's expert scientists as authors and thousands as expert reviewers. Leading experts on climate change and environmental, social, and economic sciences from some 60 nations have helped the IPCC to prepare periodic assessments of the scientific underpinnings for understanding global climate change and its consequences. With its capacity for reporting on climate change, its consequences, and the viability of adaptation and mitigation measures, the IPCC is also looked to as the official advisory body to the world's governments on the state of the science of the climate change issue. For example, the IPCC organized the development of internationally accepted methods for conducting national greenhouse gas emission inventories.</p>

In high concentrations, tropospheric ozone can be harmful to a wide range of living organisms. Tropospheric ozone acts as a greenhouse gas. In the stratosphere, ozone is created by the interaction between solar ultraviolet radiation and molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>). Stratospheric ozone plays a decisive role in the stratospheric radiative balance. Depletion of stratospheric ozone, due to chemical reactions that may be enhanced by climate change, results in an increased ground-level flux of ultraviolet (UV-) B radiation.

<p><strong>Water Vapor</strong><br />
	The most abundant greenhouse gas, it is the water present in the atmosphere in gaseous form. Water vapor is an important part of the natural greenhouse effect. While humans are not significantly increasing its concentration through direct emissions, it contributes to the enhanced greenhouse effect because the warming influence of greenhouse gases leads to a positive water vapor feedback. In addition to its role as a natural greenhouse gas, water vapor also affects the temperature of the planet because clouds form when excess water vapor in the atmosphere condenses to form ice and water droplets and precipitation. See <a href="#Greenhouse Gas (GHG)">greenhouse gas</a>. <a href="#3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p><strong><a id="Weather" name="Weather"></a>Weather</strong><br />
	Atmospheric condition at any given time or place. It is measured in terms of such things as wind, temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, cloudiness, and precipitation. In most places, weather can change from hour-to-hour, day-to-day, and season-to-season. Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the "average weather", or more rigorously, as the statistical description in terms of the mean and variability of relevant quantities over a period of time ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The classical period is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). These quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical description, of the climate system. A simple way of remembering the difference is that climate is what you expect (e.g. cold winters) and 'weather' is what you get (e.g. a blizzard). See <a href="#Climate">climate</a>.</p>

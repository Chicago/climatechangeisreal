				<h3 id="dialog-title">6,870 million metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub>: What does that mean?</h3>

				<p><strong>An explanation of units:</strong></p>

				<p>A million metric tons is equal to about 2.2 billion pounds, or 1 trillion grams. For comparison, a small car is likely to weigh a little more than 1 metric ton. Thus, a million metric tons is roughly the same mass as 1 million small cars!</p>

				<p>The U.S. Inventory uses metric units for consistency and comparability with other countries. For reference, a metric ton is a little bit larger (about 10%) than a U.S. "short" ton.</p>

				<p>GHG emissions are often measured in carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) equivalent. To convert emissions of a gas into CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent, its emissions are multiplied by the gas's <a href="/ghgemissions/understanding-global-warming-potentials">Global Warming Potential (GWP)</a>. The GWP takes into account the fact that many gases are more effective at warming Earth than CO<sub>2</sub>, per unit mass.</p>

				<p>The GWP values appearing in the Emissions webpages reflect the values used in the U.S. Inventory, which are drawn from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). For further discussion of GWPs and an estimate of GHG emissions using updated GWPs, see Annex 6 of the <a href="/ghgemissions/us-greenhouse-gas-inventory-report-1990-2014">U.S. Inventory</a> and the <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch2s2-10-2.html">IPCC's discussion on GWPs</a>. <a class="exit-disclaimer" href="/home/exit-epa" title="EPA's External Link Disclaimer">Exit</a></p>

		<ul><li><span class="menu-internal"><a href="#carbon-dioxide"><strong>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</strong></a></span>: Carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere through burning fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, and oil), solid waste, trees and wood products, and also as a result of certain chemical reactions (e.g., manufacture of cement). Carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere (or "sequestered") when it is absorbed by plants as part of the biological carbon cycle.</li>
			<li><span class="menu-internal"><a href="#methane"><strong>Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>)</strong></a></span>: Methane is emitted during the production and transport of coal, natural gas, and oil.

			<li><span class="menu-internal"><a href="#nitrous-oxide"><strong>Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O)</strong></a></span>: Nitrous oxide is emitted during agricultural and industrial activities, as well as during combustion of fossil fuels and solid waste.</li>
			<li><span class="menu-internal"><a href="#f-gases"><strong>Fluorinated gases</strong></a></span>: Hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, sulfur hexafluoride, and nitrogen trifluoride are synthetic, powerful greenhouse gases that are emitted from a variety of industrial processes. Fluorinated gases are sometimes used as substitutes for stratospheric <a href="/ozone">ozone-depleting substances</a> (e.g., chlorofluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, and halons). These gases are typically emitted in smaller quantities, but because they are potent greenhouse gases, they are sometimes referred to as High <a href="/ghgemissions/understanding-global-warming-potentials">Global Warming Potential</a> gases ("High GWP gases").</li>
		</ul><p>Each gas's effect on climate change depends on three main factors:</p>

		<p><strong>How much</strong> of these gases are in the atmosphere?</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p><strong>Concentration, or abundance</strong>, is the amount of a particular gas in the air. Larger emissions of greenhouse gases lead to higher concentrations in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gas concentrations are measured in parts per million, parts per billion, and even parts per trillion. One part per million is equivalent to one drop of water diluted into about 13 gallons of liquid (roughly the fuel tank of a compact car). To learn more about the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, visit the <a href="/climate-change-science/causes-climate-change">Causes of Climate Change</a> and the <a href="/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-atmospheric-concentrations-greenhouse-gases">Climate Change Indicators: Atmospheric Concentrations of Greenhouse Gases</a> pages.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p><strong>How long</strong> do they stay in the atmosphere?</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Each of these gases can remain in the atmosphere for different amounts of time, ranging from a few years to thousands of years. All of these gases remain in the atmosphere long enough to become well mixed, meaning that the amount that is measured in the atmosphere is roughly the same all over the world, regardless of the source of the emissions.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p><strong>How strongly</strong> do they impact global temperatures?</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Some gases are more effective than others at making the planet warmer and "thickening the Earth's blanket."</p>

			<p>For each greenhouse gas, a <a href="/ghgemissions/understanding-global-warming-potentials">Global Warming Potential (GWP)</a> has been calculated to reflect how long it remains in the atmosphere, on average, and how strongly it absorbs energy. Gases with a higher GWP absorb more energy, per pound, than gases with a lower GWP, and thus contribute more to warming Earth.</p>

		<p>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is the primary greenhouse gas emitted through human activities. In 2014, CO<sub>2</sub> accounted for about 80.9% of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from human activities. Carbon dioxide is naturally present in the atmosphere as part of the Earth's carbon cycle (the natural circulation of carbon among the atmosphere, oceans, soil, plants, and animals). Human activities are altering the carbon cycle–both by adding more CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere and by influencing the ability of natural sinks, like forests, to remove CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere. While CO<sub>2</sub> emissions come from a variety of natural sources, human-related emissions are responsible for the increase that has occurred in the atmosphere since the industrial revolution.<sup><a href="#CO2 references">1</a></sup></p>

<a href="/sites/production/files/styles/large/public/2016-05/ghge-gases-co2_3.png" target="_blank">Larger image to save or print.</a></span></span>The main human activity that emits CO<sub>2</sub> is the combustion of fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, and oil) for energy and transportation, although certain industrial processes and land-use changes also emit CO<sub>2</sub>. The main sources of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the United States are described below.</p>

		<ul><li><strong><a href="/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions#electricity">Electricity</a>.</strong> Electricity is a significant source of energy in the United States and is used to power homes, business, and industry. The combustion of fossil fuels to generate electricity is the largest single source of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the nation, accounting for about 37 percent of total U.S. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and 30 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2014. The type of fossil fuel used to generate electricity will emit different amounts of CO<sub>2</sub>. To produce a given amount of electricity, burning coal will produce more CO<sub>2 </sub>than oil or natural gas.</li>
			<li><strong><a href="/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions#transportation">Transportation</a>.</strong> The combustion of fossil fuels such as gasoline and diesel to transport people and goods is the second largest source of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, accounting for about 31 percent of total U.S. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and 25 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2014. This category includes transportation sources such as highway vehicles, air travel, marine transportation, and rail.</li>
			<li><strong><a href="/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions#industry">Industry</a>.</strong> Many industrial processes emit CO<sub>2</sub> through fossil fuel combustion. Several processes also produce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions through chemical reactions that do not involve combustion; for example, the production and consumption of mineral products such as cement, the production of metals such as iron and steel, and the production of chemicals. Fossil fuel combustion from various industrial processes accounted for about 15 percent of total U.S. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and 12 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2014. Note that many industrial processes also use electricity and therefore indirectly cause the emissions from the electricity production.</li>
		</ul><p>Carbon dioxide is constantly being exchanged among the atmosphere, ocean, and land surface as it is both produced and absorbed by many microorganisms, plants, and animals. However, emissions and removal of CO<sub>2</sub> by these natural processes tend to balance. Since the Industrial Revolution began around 1750, human activities have contributed substantially to climate change by adding CO<sub>2</sub> and other heat-trapping gases to the atmosphere.</p>

		<p>In the United States, since 1990, the management of forests and non-agricultural land has acted as a net sink of CO<sub>2</sub>, which means that more CO<sub>2</sub> is removed from the atmosphere, and stored in plants and trees, than is emitted. This sink offset about 11 percent of total emissions in 2014 and is discussed in more detail in the <a href="/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions#land-use-and-forestry">Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry</a> section.</p>

		<h3>Emissions and Trends</h3>

		<p>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions in the United States increased by about 9 percent between 1990 and 2014. Since the combustion of fossil fuel is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, changes in emissions from fossil fuel combustion have historically been the dominant factor affecting total U.S. emission trends. Changes in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fossil fuel combustion are influenced by many long-term and short-term factors, including population growth, economic growth, changing energy prices, new technologies, changing behavior, and seasonal temperatures. Between 1990 and 2014, the increase in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions corresponded with increased energy use by an expanding economy and population, and an overall growth in emissions from electricity generation. Transportation emissions also contributed to the 9 percent increase, largely due to an increase in miles traveled by motor vehicles.</p>

		<h3>Reducing Carbon Dioxide Emissions</h3>

		<p>The most effective way to reduce carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions is to reduce fossil fuel consumption. Many strategies for reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from energy are cross-cutting and apply to homes, businesses, industry, and transportation.</p>

		<p>EPA is taking common sense regulatory actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from our nation's largest sources, including power plants and motor vehicles.</p>

		<p>Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) is the second most prevalent greenhouse gas emitted in the United States from human activities. In 2014, CH<sub>4</sub> accounted for about 11 percent of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from human activities. Methane is emitted by natural sources such as wetlands, as well as human activities such as leakage from natural gas systems and the raising of livestock. Natural processes in soil and chemical reactions in the atmosphere help remove CH<sub>4</sub> from the atmosphere. Methane's lifetime in the atmosphere is much shorter than carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), but CH<sub>4</sub> is more efficient at trapping radiation than CO<sub>2</sub>. Pound for pound, the comparative impact of CH<sub>4</sub> on climate change is more than 25 times greater than CO<sub>2</sub> over a 100-year period.</p>

Also, when animals' manure is stored or managed in lagoons or holding tanks, CH<sub>4</sub> is produced. Because humans raise these animals for food, the emissions are considered human-related. Globally, the Agriculture sector is the primary source of CH<sub>4</sub> emissions. For more information, see the <a href="/ghgemissions/us-greenhouse-gas-inventory-report-1990-2014"><em>Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks</em></a> Agriculture chapter.</li>
			<li><strong><a href="/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions#commercial-and-residential">Waste from Homes and Businesses</a>.</strong> Methane is generated in landfills as waste decomposes and in the treatment of wastewater.

		<p>In 2014, nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) accounted for about 6 percent of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from human activities. Nitrous oxide is naturally present in the atmosphere as part of the Earth's nitrogen cycle, and has a variety of natural sources. However, human activities such as agriculture, fossil fuel combustion, wastewater management, and industrial processes are increasing the amount of N<sub>2</sub>O in the atmosphere. Nitrous oxide molecules stay in the atmosphere for an average of 114 years before being removed by a sink or destroyed through chemical reactions. The impact of 1 pound of N<sub>2</sub>O on warming the atmosphere is almost 300 times that of 1 pound of carbon dioxide.</p>

		<p>Globally, about 40 percent of total N<sub>2</sub>O emissions come from human activities.<sup><a href="#N2O references">1</a></sup> Nitrous oxide is emitted from agriculture, transportation, and industry activities, described below.</p>

Nitrogen takes on a variety of chemical forms throughout the nitrogen cycle, including N<sub>2</sub>O. Natural emissions of N<sub>2</sub>O are mainly from bacteria breaking down nitrogen in soils and the oceans.

		<h3>Emissions and Trends</h3>

		<p>Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) emissions in the United States have decreased by 1 percent between 1990 and 2014. This decrease in emissions is due in part to a decrease in emissions from mobile combustion resulting from emission control standards for on-road vehicles.

		<p>Unlike many other greenhouse gases, fluorinated gases have no natural sources and only come from human-related activities. They are emitted through a variety of industrial processes such as aluminum and semiconductor manufacturing. Many fluorinated gases have very high global warming potentials (GWPs) relative to other greenhouse gases, so small atmospheric concentrations can have large effects on global temperatures. They can also have long atmospheric lifetimes<span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">—</span>in some cases, lasting thousands of years. Like other long-lived greenhouse gases, fluorinated gases are well-mixed in the atmosphere, spreading around the world after they are emitted. Fluorinated gases are removed from the atmosphere only when they are destroyed by sunlight in the far upper atmosphere. In general, fluorinated gases are the most potent and longest lasting type of greenhouse gases emitted by human activities.</p>

		<p>There are four main categories of fluorinated gases<span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">—</span>hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF<sub>3</sub>). The largest sources of fluorinated gas emissions are described below.</p>

		<ul><li><strong>Substitution for Ozone-Depleting Substances.</strong> Hydrofluorocarbons are used as refrigerants, aerosol propellants, solvents, and fire retardants. The major emissions source of these compounds is their use as refrigerants—for example, in air conditioning systems in both vehicles and buildings. These chemicals were developed as a replacement for chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) because they do not deplete the stratospheric ozone layer. Chlorofluorocarbons and HCFCs are being phased out under an international agreement, called the Montreal Protocol. Unfortunately, HFCs are potent greenhouse gases with long atmospheric lifetimes and high GWPs, and they are released into the atmosphere through leaks, servicing, and disposal of equipment in which they are used.</li>
			<li><strong>Industry.</strong> Perfluorocarbons are compounds produced as a byproduct of various industrial processes associated with aluminum production and the manufacturing of semiconductors. Like HFCs, PFCs generally have long atmospheric lifetimes and high GWPs. Sulfur hexafluoride is used in magnesium processing and semiconductor manufacturing, as well as a tracer gas for leak detection. HFC-23 is produced as a byproduct of HCFC-22 production.</li>
			<li><strong>Transmission and Distribution of Electricity.</strong> Sulfur hexafluoride is used in electrical transmission equipment, including circuit breakers. The GWP of SF<sub>6</sub> is 22,800, making it the most potent greenhouse gas that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has evaluated.</li>

		<h3>Emissions and Trends</h3>

		<p>Overall, fluorinated gas emissions in the United States have increased by about 77 percent between 1990 and 2014. This increase has been driven by a 258 percent increase in emissions of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) since 1990, as they have been widely used as a substitute for ozone-depleting substances. Emissions of perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>) have actually declined during this time due to emission reduction efforts in the aluminum production industry (PFCs) and the electricity transmission and distribution industry (SF<sub>6</sub>).</p>

		<p>Going forward, HFC emissions are projected to grow by nearly 141 percent between 2005 and 2020 as demands for refrigeration continue to grow and as more ozone-depleting substances are replaced. During this same period, emissions of SF<sub>6</sub> are expected to decline by over 25 percent, while emissions of PFCs are projected to remain flat. Since the emissions from HFCs are far greater than the emissions of the other gases on a carbon dioxide-equivalence basis, substantial growth in emissions of fluorinated gases is expected to continue.<sup><a href="#F-gas reference">1</a></sup></p>

		<h3>Reducing Fluorinated Gas Emissions</h3>

		<p>Because most fluorinated gases have a very long atmospheric lifetime, it will take many years to see a noticeable decline in current concentrations. However, there are a number of ways to reduce emissions of fluorinated gases, described below. </p>

					</td>
				</tr><tr><td><strong>Industry</strong></td>
					<td>
						<p>Industrial users of fluorinated gases can reduce emissions by adopting fluorinated gas recycling and destruction processes, optimizing production to minimize emissions, and replacing these gases with alternatives.

						</ul></td>
				</tr><tr><td><strong>Electricity Transmission and Distribution</strong></td>
					<td>
						<p>Sulfur hexafluoride is an extremely potent greenhouse gas that is used for several purposes when transmitting electricity through the power grid. EPA is working with industry to reduce emissions through the <a href="/f-gas-partnership-programs/electric-power-systems-partnership">SF<sub>6</sub> Emission Reduction Partnership for Electric Power Systems</a>, which promotes leak detection and repair, use of recycling equipment, and employee training.</p>
					</td>
				</tr><tr><td><strong>Transportation</strong></td>
					<td>
						<p>Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are released through the leakage of refrigerants used in vehicle air-conditioning systems. Leakage can be reduced through better system components, and through the use of alternative refrigerants with lower global warming potentials than those presently used. One important way the EPA is working to reduce HFC emissions is through its <a href="http://epa.gov/otaq/climate/regulations.htm">light-duty and heavy-duty vehicle standards</a>.</p>
